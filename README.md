You can view [surveys](https://main--6234a36a932a74003a2e9141.chromatic.com) and [edit history](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=6234a36a932a74003a2e9141&branch=main) using storybook and chromatic.

# 

To view this survey library, run

`npm install` 

to install the dependencies, and then type:

`npm run storybook`

then you can view the storybook at:

`http:localhost:6006`

# Todos:
- would be nice to move the surveys folder to the root (and out of src) but storybook (via webpack) requires it to be in the src directory. I don't know enough about webpack to fix this.
