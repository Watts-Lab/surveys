# Standardized Survey Library

## Installation
`npm i @wattslab/surveys`

## Goals

This repository is a centralized location for storing, documenting, versioning, and providing surveys to be used across projects within the CSS lab and the wider social science community. 

### Centralized Storage
To the extent possible, the lab's surveys are stored in this repository to enable reuse across projects while maintaining consistency. This repository provides the implementation of record for each survey, including the questions asked, relevant stimuli (such as RME images), correct answers when applicable (such as in the CRT), and code for aggregating responses into a score. This ensures consistency between different uses of the same survey, so that results from one use of the survey can be compared with results from other uses.

### Documentation
Surveys are documented with the source of the survey instrument itself, whether it be a publication from the literature or an internal survey development process. The documentation cites other publications that have used the particular survey instrument. For internally developed surveys, the documentation gives a summary of the purpose of the survey, how it was developed, and how it was validated.

The documentation is written in language that can be used verbatim e.g. in the supplement to a paper using the survey, to describe its use. 

`.bib` files to document our citation. Within the readme for each survey, reference a unique .bib file that includes the list of sources you referenced in designing that particular survey.
