# Willing to Talk

This survey measures participants willingness to return to a difficult conversation environment, topic, and partner, along with their willingness to engage in difficult conversations in the world.

# Stakeholders for this survey

Different stakeholders have different interests in making people more willing to return, so we want to ask both about re-engagement with the group and separately re-engagement with the topic, and also engagement with people they disagree with in general.

1. Bridging organizations are interested in getting people to engage more generally with people that they disagree with. This would mean that their work is helping to create dialog between cross-partisans outside the direct context of the intervention itself, either about the assigned topic or another topic of disagreement. In addition, the existence of the "contact theory" literature and its general agreement that just getting to know people who disagree with you helps them seem more human and less "other", we might be interested in increasing general willingness to have a conversation with an out-partisan as a general good in its own right.
2. Individuals who are in existing or nascent relationships care about ensuring a willingness to invest further in those relationships, even if the discussion topic never comes up again, because they care about building relationships with other people.
3. Managers or committee conveners care about ensuring commitment to ongoing productive discussions to achieve some outcome with respect to that topic, and so care about willingness to reengage both with the same group and the same topic.
4. Educators might be interested in encouraging people to reengage with a particular topic, to improve their learning about that topic, etc.
5. As experimenters, we are interested in whether people would return to our specific experimental context for another discussion. In addition to their experience of the discussion, this would probably also depend on their experience of the rest of the experiment process, and so we shouldn't rely on it alone as a signal of the quality of the discussion, but it is useful because if down the road we are implementing interventions in non-experimental contexts, we want to know the effects of those interventions in aggregate with the quality of the discussion.

# Examples from the literature

Questions in this vein are common in the deliberation literature, and get at three major areas: general willingness to engage with disagreers in the world, willingness to return to a discussion topic, and willingess to return to a discussion group:

## Willingness to engage with disagreers/outparty in general

> "whether participants expressed a behavioral intention to engage with outparty. We measured this with three items: **Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they would be interested in having another conversation with a member of the outparty, if they would learn from such a conversation,** and of the participants who indicated that they had a conversation, if they would be interested in meeting up with their partner again. We formed an index with all three items."

> "How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements? (1) I am confident in my abilityto have fruitful conversations with the people that I hate/disagree with the most. (2) I can collaborate well with the people who I hate/disagree with the most."

### Rossiter, Erin. 2023. “The Similar and Distinct Effects of Political and Non-Political Conversation on Affective Polarization.”

> "In Study 2, participants were asked about their willingness to have future conversations with outpartisans. To assess willingness to have future non-political conversations, I asked about willingness to talk about "family," as it is akin to the non-political conversation prompt of meaning of life in the experiment. Likewise, to assess willingness to have future political conversations, I asked abouf "immigration," as that was the political topic prompt. Specifically, participants were asked to indicate their agreement on a five point scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) for the following questions: "I am willing to have a conversation about my family with a person that identifies as [Democrat/Republican]" and "I am willing to have a conversation about immigration with a person that identifies as [Democrat/Republican]."

## Willingness to have another conversation with the same group:

> "Would you like to have a conversation with this person again in the future? (Yes/No)"

### Rossiter, Erin. 2023. “The Similar and Distinct Effects of Political and Non-Political Conversation on Affective Polarization.”

> In Study 1, participants were asked about their willingness to talk politics again with their assigned conversation partner, asking agreement on a five point scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) for the statement "I would chat with my conversation partner about politics."

### Santoro, Erik, and David E. Broockman. 2022. “The Promise and Pitfalls of Cross-Partisan Conversations for Reducing Affective Polarization: Evidence from Randomized Experiments.” Science Advances 8 (25).

> Intent to remain in the team. We measured intent to remain with 3 items focused on members’ desire to stay in or leave the team (i.e., “If I could have left this team and worked with another team, I would have,” “I wouldn’t hesitate to participate on another task with the same team members,” and “If given the choice, I would prefer to work with another team rather than this one.”). Items were rated on a 5-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly dis-agree)to5(strongly agree).

> The specific questions used to measure satisfaction with membership and satisfaction with output were developed for this study. Satisfaction with membership was composed of three items: Being a member of this team has been personally satisfying, **I would choose this team to work with on similar tasks in the future**, and being a member of this team was a positive experience. Satisfaction with output was also composed of three items: I am satisfied with the final project of this team, we did an excellent job on our case analysis, and the team’s final paper is better than what I could have done on my own.

## Willingness to have another conversation about the same topic:

### Rossiter, Erin. 2023. “The Similar and Distinct Effects of Political and Non-Political Conversation on Affective Polarization.”

> To assess willingness to have future political conversations, I asked about "immigration," as that was the political topic prompt. Specifically, participants were asked to indicate their agreement on a five point scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) for the following questions... "I am willing to have a conversation about immigration with a person that identifies as [Democrat/Republican]."

# Objectives for this survey

1. We would like to be able to ask questions in a "behavioral" way to get a more honest signal about people's intentions. They should feel they are making a choice that we will act on later.
2. We want to make sure that the behavioral questions measure desire to re-engage, not logistical constraints such as difficulty scheduling.
3. Ideally, the survey could be used for discussions with 2,3 or more participants, so not using language of "discussion partner". We can get at attitudes towards discussion partners with a separate survey.
4. We want the survey to be concise, and not take participants much time, so that we can also include other measures.
5. Ideally, we could use the same survey for agreeing and disagreeing groups
6. Question about returning to the group should be agnostic to the topic, and vice versa.

# Operationalization

- Would you like to participate in conversation studies like this one in the future? (yes/no)

- Would you like to have another conversation with your discussion partner(s) in the future, about this or other topics? (yes/no)

- Would you like to discuss this topic again in the future, possibly with a different group? (yes/no)

### More generically:

- Would you like to participate in studies like this one in the future? (yes/no).
