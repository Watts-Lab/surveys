In designing our quality control exit survey, the research team intends to record feedback from participants in our deliberation experiment. We seek to probe participants for their feelings related to critical aspects of the experimental design, ease of participation, the percieved fairness of compensation, and overall enjoyment in the experiment. Because the survey is short and optional, we expect to recieve responses from participants willing to offer thoughtful feedback on their survey experience.
