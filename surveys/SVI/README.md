# Subjective Value Inventory

## Survey Purpose

The purpose of this survey is to measure the range of social psychological outcomes of negotiation that are valued *subjectively*, rather than objectively (e.g., monetary pay-off). This construct, *subjective value*, is a key predictor of future negotiation decisions.

## Theoretical construct

Per the original paper by Curhan et al. (2006), one's subjective feelings about negotiation involves 4 underlying subconstructs: (1) Feelings About the Instrumental Outcome, (2) Feelings About the Self, (3) Feelings About the Negotiation Process, and (4) Feelings About the Relationship.

# Adaptations

We stuck to the original survey from http://www.subjectivevalue.com/ as closely as possible. The only modification was that we shortened the lengths of some of the scale points.

- "It positively/negatively impacted my self-image" was modified to "Extremely Negative/Neutral/Extremely Positive"
- "It made me feel more/less competent" was modified to "Much Less/Neutral/Much More"

The "NA" option in the original was retained and encoded as undefined, such that all NA responses are dropped from sub-scales when calculating the result.
