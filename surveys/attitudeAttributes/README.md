# Attitude attributes

Attitudes towards an issue can be productively measured on a Likert scale with values ranging from "agree"-"disagree" or "definitely no"-"definitely yes", etc.

> **Should the United States return to a gold standard?**
>
> My opinion is...
>
> - Strongly Yes
> - Moderately Yes
> - Leaning towards Yes
> - Neutral
> - Leaning towards No
> - Moderately No
> - Strongly No

This measure, however, captures only one aspect of an attitude towards a particular issue, the "Attitude Extremity". There are a number of additional dimensions that describe an individual's attitude towards a topic, and that influence behavior in different ways.

The present survey synthesizes several different catalogs of attitude attributes that can be measured with survey items. In general, this means that the questions lean towards "meta-attitudinal" measures that are "based on the person’s own assessment of his or her attitude." (Miller and Peterson, 2004) We will use a different surveys to ask people to list their knowledge of arguments for and against an issue, and to demonstrate more behavioral attitude dimensions.

### Items

In almost all cases, we will need to adapt a question that was written about a specific issue (e.g. "How knowledgeable would you say you are about recycling"?) to a more general structure.

### Scales

Normally in this library, we try to use 7 point scales when possible, when the question provides enough meaningful granularity. However, all of the questions listed here estimate a quantity, using a "how much" style formulation, rather than a "strongly disagree... neutral... strongly agree" symmetrical structure. Also, we don't expect to run repeat before/after surveys using these measures, so a fine level of granularity may not add as much value. So, we've used 5-point scales as perhaps more appropriate for these questions, and requiring less cognitive load for the participants.

In addition, we choose not to use "no opinion/i haven't thought about this" options in the scale points, as these have been found to correlate more with survey satisficing than with actual lack of an issue position (Jon A. Krosnick Charles M. Judd Bernd Wittenbrink. 2014. “The Measurement of Attitudes.” In The Handbook of Attitudes, edited by Albarracin, D. Johnson, B.T. Zanna, M.P., 21–76. Psychology Press.) and (Boudreau, Cheryl, and Arthur Lupia. 2011. “Political Knowledge.” In Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science, 171–84. Cambridge University Press.). The GSS is also moving away from "Don't know" questions. Instead, we assess the confidence in a belief as an independent aspect of the extremity of that belief.

When the scale expresses a quantity (how much, etc.) we have ordered the scales from smallest to largest.

### Method

In the sections below, we show how a number of different experimenters have operationalized each attitude dimension. This is far from a comprehensive list, but serves to illustrate the points of diversity and convergence among at least a subset of the literature. This is far from a comprehensive list, and rather than creating a perfect measures attempts to identify reasonably independent attributes of attitude that can be used as predictors of discussion outcomes.

Assembling this list was complicated because (I'm not joking) many of the papers that are entirely based on these measures don't give the actual wording for the survey questions they used to achieve them. This means that (a) some degree of interpretation is necessary, and (b) making your own interpretation is close to being standard practice.

The operationalizations chosen here are best judgements that try to represent each of the underlying constructs in a way that they can be meaningfully distinguished from one another, and are reasonably clear.

## Importance

"Attitude importance refers to a person's perception of the amount of personal importance he or she attaches to an attitude" (Duane T. Wegener John Downing Jon A. Krosnick Richard E. Petty. 1995. “Measures and Manipulations of Strength-Related Properties of Attitudes: Current Practice and Future Directions.” In Attitude Strength, Antecedents and Consequences, edited by Richard E. Petty Jon Krosnick, 455–82.)

"The measures of importance used in political science are all meta-attitudinal. They explicitly ask the respondent to report how important an attitude or issue is." (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

"Attitude importance refers to the amount of psychological significance a person ascribes to an attitude" (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

#### Format 1: "Important to you personally?

> How important is this issue to you personally? ( Not at all / Slightly / Moderately / Somewhat / Very ) (Ryan, Timothy J. 2014. “Reconsidering Moral Issues in Politics.” The Journal of Politics 76 (2): 380–97.)

> Importance: How important is recycling to you personally? (1 = Not at all important; 5 = Extremely important) (Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

#### Format 2: "Care a lot about"

> Participants also reported their degree of attitude importance related to the issue by responding to two items asking them the extent to which their position was “something that you care a lot about?” and “personally important to you?” Similar to moral conviction, they responded using a 5-point scale with the response options not at all, slightly, moderately, much, and very much. These two items were averaged to create a single index of people’s attitude importance related to the issue. (Wisneski, Daniel C., Brittany E. Hanson, and G. Scott Morgan. 2020. “The Roles of Disgust and Harm Perception in Political Attitude Moralization.” Politics and the Life Sciences: The Journal of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences 39 (2): 215–27.)

> How much would you say that you personally care about the way the election to the U.S. House of Representatives comes out: do you care VERY MUCH, PRETTY MUCH, NOT VERY MUCH or NOT AT ALL? (ANES: https://electionstudies.org/data-tools/anes-variable/variable.html?year=2008&variable=V083034)

#### Format 3: Concerned about

> How concerned are you that some people in the government today might want to undermine the news media's ability to serve as a check on governmental power? (Refused / Don't Know / Not at all concerned / A little concerned / Moderately concerned / Very concerned / Extremely Concerned)

#### Format 4: Importance of your attitude

> How important is your attitude toward the issue (of doctor-assisted suicide) to you personally? How much does your attitude toward the issue of doctor-assisted suicide mean to you? (1:Not at all important ... 7:Very important) (Haddock, Geoffrey, Alexander J. Rothman, Rolf Reber, and Norbert Schwarz. 1999. “Forming Judgments of Attitude Certainty, Intensity, and Importance: The Role of Subjective Experiences.” Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin 25 (7): 771–82.)

> How important to you is your opinion about U.S. involvement in Libya? (1: not too important / 2 / 3: moderately important / 4 /5: extremely important) (Leeper, Thomas J. 2014. “The Informational Basis for Mass Polarization.” Public Opinion Quarterly 78 (1): 27–46.)

#### Format 5: In the context of voting

> "How important, if at all, are each of the following issues in making your decision about who to vote for in the 2020 presidential election? ... Matrix answers: (Immigration / Abortion / etc.) (Very important / Somewhat important / Not too important / Not important at all) (PEW https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/PP_2020.08.13_Voter-Attitudes_TOPLINE.pdf)

> How important will each of the following issues be to your vote for Congress this year -- will it be extremely important, very important, moderately important, or not that important? (Extremely important / very important / Moderately important / Not that important) (Gallup https://news.gallup.com/poll/404243/economy-top-election-issue-abortion-crime-next.aspx)

### Discussion

One thing we want to do here is separate the dimension of "importance" from that of personal relevance. For example, "how important is this issue to you personally?" could be interpreted as "how much does this issue affect you personally?". Need to include this in our choice.

Miller and Peterson distinguish between the _national_ importance of an issue, and its _personal_ importance to the respondent, saying "the bulk of the extant work suggests that national importance judgments are not cognitively and behaviorally impactful, whereas personal importance judgments are" and "measures of personal importance seem to be more appropriate for gauging a dimension of attitude strength, whereas measures of national importance are not." In this survey, we choose only to consider personal importance.

Haddock et al. (1999) ask about a subtly different question: how important is your _attitude_ regarding the issue to you, rather than how important the _issue_ is itself. In this survey we'll focus on the latter.

Additionally, some of the national surveys make a distinction between how important the issue is, and how important the issue is in helping decide who they will vote for. We focus on the generic importance of the issue.

### Operationalization

In this operationalization, we use the ANES text verbatim, excluding the "don't know" and "refused" options.
`How important is this issue to you personally?" (Not at all important / Not too important / Somewhat important / Very Important / Extremely Important)`

## Perceived Knowledge

"Knowledge typically refers to the information stored in memory regarding an attitude object (issue). Such information could include beliefs about attributes of the object, memories of one's past behaviors relevant to the object, or memories of feelings associated with the object" (Duane T. Wegener John Downing Jon A. Krosnick Richard E. Petty. 1995. “Measures and Manipulations of Strength-Related Properties of Attitudes: Current Practice and Future Directions.” In Attitude Strength, Antecedents and Consequences, edited by Richard E. Petty Jon Krosnick, 455–82.)

"Knowledge. Knowledge refers to the amount of information about an object that accompanies one's attitude toward it in memory and is assessed by knowledge listings (Wood, 1982), quiz questions (Iyengar, 1990), and self-reports of knowledge- ability (Kanwar, Grund, & Olson, 1990)" ()

"Knowledge refers to the information about an attitude object that is stored in memory, ranging in volume from very large to none at all" (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

#### Format 1: Familiarity

> In your own assessment, how familiar are you with politics and societal matters? (Very familiar / Familiar/ Pretty familiar / not very familiar / not at all familiar / cannot say) (Rapeli, Lauri. 2022. “What Is the Best Proxy for Political Knowledge in Surveys?” PloS One 17 (8): e0272530.)

> How familiar are you with the topic of this task? (1: Not at all / 4: Somewhat / 7: Extremely) (Cole, Michael J., Xiangmin Zhang, Jinging Liu, Chang Liu, Nicholas J. Belkin, Ralf Bierig, and Jacek Gwizdka. 2010. “Are Self-Assessments Reliable Indicators of Topic Knowledge?” Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 47 (1): 1–10.)

#### Format 2: Well-informedness

> A typical survey measure of self-assessed political sophistication is a simple question such as ‘how well informed would you say you are of political matters? (Rapeli, Lauri. 2022. “What Is the Best Proxy for Political Knowledge in Surveys?” PloS One 17 (8): e0272530.)

> For self-assessment, the analysis relies on the item ‘In your own assessment, how familiar are you with politics and societal matters?’ The English translation does not perhaps quite do justice to the original formulation. The Finnish-speaking respondents will have understood the question as pertaining to how well informed they are about politics, rather than ‘being familiar’ in a more general sense. The responses were recorded on a 5-step Likert-scale: ‘Very familiar’; ‘Familiar; ‘Pretty familiar’; ‘Not very familiar’; ‘Not at all familiar’. (Rapeli, Lauri. 2021. “Accuracy of Self-Assessments of Political Sophistication.” In Perspectives on Political Awareness: Conceptual, Theoretical and Methodological Issues, 97–114.)

#### Format 3

> Perceived Knowledge: How knowledgeable would you say you are about recycling? (1 = Not at all knowledgeable; 5 = Extremely knowledgeable) (Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

#### Format 4: expanded levels of understanding

> Beside each one of the techniques/topics listed below circle the number which you think most closely represents your level of understanding for that topic:
>
> 1. “I have never heard of this.”
> 2. “I have heard of this, but don’t understand what it is all about.”
> 3. “I have heard of this and partly understand what it is about.”
> 4. “I have a reasonable knowledge and understanding of this.”
> 5. “I am very confident about my understanding of and use of this.”
>    (Cassidy, Simon, and Peter Eachus. 2000. “Learning Style, Academic Belief Systems, Self-Report Student Proficiency and Academic Achievement in Higher Education.” Educational Psychology Review 20 (3): 307–22.)

### Discussion

Political knowledge can be assessed both through self reports and by testing participants on particular facts, and asking them how many of the responses they think they got correct. Surprisingly, self assessed political knowledge may in some contexts (ie, such as online surveys) be more reliable than actually asking factual questions (which can be googled). In addition, it is unclear whether we can make "generalizations of citizen competence or knowledge on a relatively small set of idiosyncratic, fact-based survey questions" (Boudreau, Cheryl, and Arthur Lupia. 2011. “Political Knowledge.” In Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science, 171–84. Cambridge University Press.)

On the other hand, there is evidence that self-assessed knowledge correlates more with motivation and learning satisfaction than it does with actual knowledge (Sitzmann, Traci, Katherine Ely, Kenneth G. Brown, and Kristina N. Bauer. 2010. “Self-Assessment of Knowledge: A Cognitive Learning or Affective Measure?” Academy of Management Learning & Education 9 (2): 169–91.)

Fortunately, we may be able to use perceived knowledge as a useful independent variable. We don't particularly need to measure actual knowledge of a topic, as the perception of knowledge is likely to have interesting effects in its own right.

In addition, we are going to be asking about knowledge of specific issues, not political knowledge in general.
As a result, we use self-assessments of knowledge about an issue, so that we can use the same measure across a wide range of issues while having confidence that we can compare the results across the issue space.

#### Operationalization

## Accessibility

> "The accessibility of an attitude refers to how easily or quickly it can be retrieved from memory (Fazio, 1995). The speed of retrieval is presumed to indicate the strength of the link in memory between the representation of the object and the evaluation of it." (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

> "Attitude accessibility refers to the ease with which an evaluation comes to mind when one encounters an attitude object" (Wegener, Downing, Krosnick and Petty, 1995)

> "accessibility is by far the most ubiquitous measure of attitude strength in political science." (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

#### Format 1: Measured Latency

> "Researchers often operationalize accessibility as the amount of time between the presentation of an attitude object and the individual's reported evaluation of it" (Wegener, Downing, Krosnick and Petty, 1995)

#### Format 2: Self Report

> Perceived Accessibility: How easily does your evaluation of recycling come to mind? (1 = Not at all easily; 5 = Extremely easily) (Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

> Holbrook and Krosnick (2003; see also Bassili 1996) asked respondents three questions to assess accessibility meta-attitudinally: “How long did it take you to think of your opinion about issue X?” “Did your opinion come to mind slowly, quickly or neither slowly nor quickly?” and “Compared to your opinion about other issues, how quickly did your opinion about legalized abortion come to mind?” (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

### Discussion

In an ideal world, we'll be able to directly measure latency for all questions we ask in the experiment.

Some suggest that latency and self-reports map to different constructs: "both Bassili (1996) and Holbrook and Krosnick (2003) find that operative measures of accessibility (namely, response time meas- ures) and meta-attitudinal measures of accessibility are, in fact, separate and unre- lated constructs and therefore should not be used interchangeably" (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

### Operationalization

May choose not to include this dimension in a self-report survey, as it adds length and potential confusion without perhaps having a clearly defined construct in that format. Instead, we should work out how to measure latency in responses to the original attitude survey questions.

## Certainty

> "Certainty refers to the confidence with which an individual holds an attitude: The more confidently an individual believes the attitude to be correct, the more certainty is present" (Wegener, Downing, Krosnick and Petty, 1995)

> "Attitude certainty refers to the amount of confidence a person attaches to an attitude." (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

### Format 1: How certain?

> How certain are you about your opinion about U.S. involvement in Libya? (1: not certain at all / 2 / 3: moderately certain / 4 /5: extremely certain) (Leeper, Thomas J. 2014. “The Informational Basis for Mass Polarization.” Public Opinion Quarterly 78 (1): 27–46.)

> How certain are you of YOUR position on this scale? (Very Certain, Pretty Certain, Not Very Certain) (ANES: https://electionstudies.org/data-tools/anes-variable/variable.html?year=1996&variable=V960524)

> How certain are you about your attitude toward (doctor-assisted suicide)? (1. Not at all certain ... 7. Very certain ) (Haddock, Geoffrey, Alexander J. Rothman, Rolf Reber, and Norbert Schwarz. 1999. “Forming Judgments of Attitude Certainty, Intensity, and Importance: The Role of Subjective Experiences.” Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin 25 (7): 771–82.)

### Format 2: how firm

> "How firm is your opinion toward the issue of (doctor-assisted suicide)?" (1. Not at all firm ... 7. Very firm ) (Haddock, Geoffrey, Alexander J. Rothman, Rolf Reber, and Norbert Schwarz. 1999. “Forming Judgments of Attitude Certainty, Intensity, and Importance: The Role of Subjective Experiences.” Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin 25 (7): 771–82.)

#### Format 4:

> How sure are you that your opinion about (recycling) is correct? (1 = Not sure at all; 9 = Extremely sure)(Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

#### Format 5:

> Are you very certain of where you stand on this issue, pretty certain, or not very certain?

- Alvarez, R. Michael, and Charles H. Franklin. 1994. “Uncertainty and Political Perceptions.” The Journal of Politics 56 (3): 671–88.

### Discussion

For some reason, the majority of scales of certainty do not label all scale points. Perhaps this is appropriate in this context, but in order to keep the presentation consistent with other questions in this survey, we have adapted scale point labels for this particular question.

### Operationalization

`How certain are you about your opinion on this topic?`
`Not at all certain / Slightly certain / Moderately certain / Mostly certain / Completely certain`

## Ambivalence

> "Ambivalence refers to the degree to which a person has both favorable and unfavorable reactions to an object. For example, a person may recognize both admirable and despicable qualities in a particular individual, or may see both pros and cons of a proposed policy. Ambivalence, then, is the degree of evaluative conflict in a person’s responses to an object, with maximum ambivalence occurring when favorable and unfavorable responses are both maximally strong (Thompson, Zanna, & GriY n, 1995)" (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

> "Ambivalence refers to the extent to which one's reactions to an attitude object are evaluatively mixed in that both positive (favorable) and negative (unfavorable) elements are included" (Wegener, Downing, Krosnick and Petty, 1995)

Ambivalence seems to tap into the idea that a person may see convincing arguments on both sides of an issue and weigh them together in creating an overall evaluation. This is distinct from a common interpretation of having no strong opinion.

> "For a person who is entirely univalent, which consideration is accessible makes no difference; for a person who is completely ambivalent, which considerations are accessible make all the difference." (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

#### Format 1: Mixed (cognitive basis)

> "Would you say that you are strongly on one side or the other on the <blank> issue, or would you say your feelings are mixed?" (Tourangeau, Rasinski, Bradburn, and D' Andrade, 1989)

> "assess the extent to which their reactions were ... mixed" (0: Completely one-sided / 10: completely mixed reaction) (Priester, J. R., and R. E. Petty. 1996. “The Gradual Threshold Model of Ambivalence: Relating the Positive and Negative Bases of Attitudes to Subjective Ambivalence.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (3): 431–49.)

> "How mixed are your thoughts and feelings about issue X" (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

#### Format 2: Indecisive (cognitive basis)

> "assess the extent to which their reactions were ... indecisive" (0: Feel no indecision at all / 10: feel maximum indecision) (Priester, J. R., and R. E. Petty. 1996. “The Gradual Threshold Model of Ambivalence: Relating the Positive and Negative Bases of Attitudes to Subjective Ambivalence.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (3): 431–49.)

> "How indecisive are your thoughts and feelings about issue X" (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

#### Format 3: Conflict (affective basis)

> To what extent do you feel conflict when you think about recycling? (1 = not at all; 9 = very much) (Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

> (Question not given) (0: Feel no conflict at all / 10: Feel maximum conflict) (Priester, J. R., and R. E. Petty. 1996. “The Gradual Threshold Model of Ambivalence: Relating the Positive and Negative Bases of Attitudes to Subjective Ambivalence.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (3): 431–49.)

> "How much conflict do you feel about the good and bad aspects of issue X" (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

#### Format 4: Operative variance in responses

> "Alvarez and Brehm (2002) use the patterns of the error variance in the estimation as an operative estimate of the degree of ambivalence. They use a heteroskedastic model to estimate the effects of various predictors (such as the amount of information the person has received or the person’s sophistication) on the error variance in their attitudes. They then use the relationships between these predictors and the attitudinal error variance to determine if the sample is ambivalent, uncertain, or equivocal. If the error variance is driven by information levels (the more informed the more variance) then the public’s opinion is said to be ambivalent." (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

### Discussion

Ambivalence and accessibility seem to be interacting constructs - in that those who are highly "ambivalent" may be more susceptible to priming, and so accessibility of opinions will be important. "Lavine (2001) makes this point most clearly, noting that ambivalence drives one’s susceptibility to persuasion (Bassili 1996), determines the accessibility of considerations (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1998), opinion stability (Zaller and Feldman 1992), and context dependence." (Joanne M. Miller David A. M. Peterson. 2004. “Theoretical and Empirical Implications of Attitude Strength.” The Journal of Politics 66 (3): 847–67.)

### Operationalization

## Personal Relevance

"Personal relevance refers to the extent to which people believe that a topic or attitude object holds significant consequences for some aspect of their lives, (e.g., their outcomes, values, possessions, groups). When the attitude topic has personal relevance, people are said to be personally involved with it."

"Assessments of personal relevance have generally asked how likely the attutude object or issue is to affect the respondent personally, how relevant respondents perceive the issue to be, or how likely it is that a proposal affecting the respondent will be instituted" (Petty, Richard E., and Jon A. Krosnick, eds. Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences. Psychology Press, 2014.)

"personal relevance, can be defined as the degree to which an attitude object affects an individual’s hedonically relevant outcomes (e.g. Marsh & Wallace, 2005)

#### Format 1:

There may be issues where the discussion topic question doesn't have an explicit _outcome_ (e.g. "Is the ACLU good for america?", "Can alternative energy effectively replace fossil fuels?") but would still affect a person directly.

#### Format 2:

## Moral Conviction

> "Moral conviction refers to a meta-cognition about an attitude — specifically, one’s belief that a given attitude is a reflection of one’s core feelings or beliefs about fundamental right and wrong, or morality and immorality (Skitka et al., in press). (Wisneski, Daniel C., Brittany E. Hanson, and G. Scott Morgan. 2020. “The Roles of Disgust and Harm Perception in Political Attitude Moralization.” Politics and the Life Sciences: The Journal of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences 39 (2): 215–27.)

> According to Skitka (2010), morally convicted attitudes have three defining characteristics: (1) they are perceived as universal truths (p. 269); (2) they are experienced “as if they were readily observable, objective properties of situations, or as facts about the world” (p. 269); and (3) they operate independent of external authorities (p. 270).

### Discussion

Several papers use composite measures made up of several of the below formats. Wisneski averages 1,2,3 and 4. These are papers that focus primarily on moral conviction, and so have the luxury of being able to spend more questions on the same construct.

### Operationalization

`“To what extent is your position on this issue a reflection of your core moral beliefs and convictions?”`
`Not at all / Slightly / Moderately / Strongly / Completely`

## Perceived Elaboration

> "Elaboration is the extent to which an individual has carefully scrutinized and thought about the merits of information relevant to the attitude object" (Duane T. Wegener John Downing Jon A. Krosnick Richard E. Petty. 1995. “Measures and Manipulations of Strength-Related Properties of Attitudes: Current Practice and Future Directions.” In Attitude Strength, Antecedents and Consequences, edited by Richard E. Petty Jon Krosnick, 455–82.)

> "Some attitudes are formed as a result of in‐depth, highly elaborative thought processes. Others are formed through more superficial, cue‐driven processes that require relatively little thought (Petty, Haugtvedt, & Smith, 1995)." (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

#### Format 1: How much you've thought about the issue

> Perceived Elaboration: In general, how much would you say you've thought about recycling? (1 = Not at all; 5 = Extremely frequently) (Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

## Centrality

> Centrality: How much is your attitude toward recycling related to how you view yourself as a person? (1 = Not at all; 5 = Extremely) (Luttrell, Andrew, Richard E. Petty, Pablo Briñol, and Benjamin C. Wagner. 2016. “Making It Moral: Merely Labeling an Attitude as Moral Increases Its Strength.” Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 65 (July): 82–93.)

## Structural consistency

> "Closely related to ambivalence are three aspects of structural consistency involving a person’s overall evaluation of an object, the evaluative implications of his or her beliefs about the object’s qualities, and the evaluative valence of his or her emotional reactions to the object. Evaluative‐aVective, evaluative‐cognitive, and aVective‐cognitive consistency are the terms used to refer to the three possible manifestations of consistency (Chaiken, Pomerantz, & Giner‐Sorolla, 1995)" (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

## Intensity

> "Attitude intensity is the strength of the emotional reaction provoked by the attitude object in an individual. It has typically been measured using self‐reports of the intensity of feelings a person says he or she has about the object (Cantril, 1944, 1946; StouVer et al., 1950)." (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

## Extremity

> "Attitudes are typically conceptualized as lying on a continuum from very positive through neutral to very negative. Attitudes that lie toward either end of this continuum are considered to be extreme (Abelson, 1995). Extremity has usually been derived from reports of attitudes on rating scales.",
>
> "Extremity is a feature of the attitude itself: where along a bipolar evaluative continuum an attitude falls"
>
> "Attitude extremity is unique among strength‐related dimensions, because whereas the other dimensions refer to attributes of or judgments about the attitude, extremity refers to the attitude itself (where, along a bipolar contin- uum, the attitude falls). Thus, extremity is the only dimension that is not independent of the content of the attitude: attitudes that diVer in extremity are, by definition, diVerent attitudes."
> (Visser, Penny S., George Y. Bizer, and Jon A. Krosnick. 2006. “Exploring the Latent Structure of Strength‐related Attitude Attributes.” In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38:1–67. Academic Press.)

We use separate questions (ie, the actual opinion scale) to measure extremity
