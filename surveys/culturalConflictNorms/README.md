# Cultural Conflict Norms

A moderator for conflict in conversations has to do with how people are taught to surface or suppress conflict. Some cultures value avoiding conflict and others value raising it.

## Design decisions

### "Culture" vs group norms

People are socialized both by their culture of origin and the culture of the environment in which conflict takes place. For example, the same person may surface conflict with their athletic team because doing so improves their performance, but suppress conflict at work because their boss is controlling.

### Repeating the context

We could pull "in my home culture" out of all the questions, but repeating it reminds participants of what we want them to consider when asking the question. We don't want them to consider their opinion of the world more generally, or their most recent discussion.

## Operationalization

We're interested in learning how your cultural background has shaped your approach to handling conflict.

Do you agree, disagree, or neither agree nor disagree with the following statements?

1. In my culture, conflict is usually dealt with openly.
2. In my culture, people try to avoid conflict at all costs. (R)
3. If a conflict arises in my culture, the people involved initiate steps to resolve the conflict immediately. (R)
4. Conflict is detrimental to getting work done in my culture. (R)
5. Emotional displays (i.e. crying, yelling) are accepted by my culture.
6. In my culture, disagreements are encouraged.
7. Differences of opinion are avoided in my culture. (R)

Higher values indicate norms towards openness towards conflict and acceptance of disagreement.
