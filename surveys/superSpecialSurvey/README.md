# Survey Purpose

This particular survey aims to use the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) to quantify the particpant's Big-Five personality dimensions.

# Expected behavior

We expect that perticipants will thoughtfully complete this survey, selecting the choice for each prompt that most closely reflects their evaluation of their own personality.

# Design Rationale

We used survey items developed by Samuel D Gosling, Peter J Rentfrow, and William B Swann, in their paper on measuring the Big-Five personality domains.

Scores range from 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly)
