# Party Identification

From `Van Holsteyn & Galen A. Irwin, Joop J. M. 2017. “Party Identification.” In The SAGE Encyclopedia of Political Behavior, edited by Fathali M. Moghaddam. SAGE Publications, Inc.`

> The operationalization of party identification by Angus Campbell and his colleagues in the 1950s and 1960s has become a staple in the American national election studies. The standard question wording in these stud- ies has been this: _Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an In- dependent, or what?_ The phrase think of yourself emphasizes self-identification, while generally and usually indicate the identification with the party should be an enduring one.

> This standard question primarily taps the direction of party identification and a follow-up question is assumed to tap its intensity. For Republican and Democratic identifiers, the follow-up question is, _Would you call yourself a strong (Republican/Democrat) or a not very strong (Republican/Democrat)?_ For Independents, direction and intensity are combined in one ques- tion: Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party? The results of these questions can be combined to form a 7-point unidimensional scale: Strong Republican, Weak Republi- can, Leaning Republican, Independent, Leaning Democrat, Weak Democrat, and Strong Democrat.

These initial questions are implemented verbatim.
