# Survey Purpose

This survey implements the "Constructive Listening Behaviors" portion of the Facilitating Listening Scale.

> The Facilitating Listening Scale (FLS) assesses speaker perceptions of the listening behaviors of their interlocutors and the consequences of these behaviors for the speakers.

(All text quotations from Kluger and Bouskila-Yam, 2017, unless noted otherwise)

This particular survey allows us to take a measure of a participant's subjective experience of working with the other perticipants throughout a given experiment. In this implementation **this survey records how well a participant felt they listened to by others in their conversation**.
