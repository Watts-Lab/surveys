# Survey Purpose

This particular survey allows us to take a measure of a participant's subjective experience of working with the other perticipants throughout a given experiment. This will be a key factor in our analysis of various deliberation treatments.

# Expected behavior

We expect that perticipants will thoughtfully complete this survey, selecting the choice for each prompt that most closely reflects their opinion of working with their deliberation group.

# Design Rationale

We used survey items developed by Jessica Nicole Cooperstein in her paper on developing a measure for team viability. These items have been reviewed by field experts.
