# Example Survey

## Purpose
This survey is included as a reference for how to include and document new surveys.
Surveys in the `/surveys` folder should be `.json` files containing the SurveyJS
json representation of your survey. 

## Expected behavior
This survey asks about whether the respondent would recommend a product to a friend.
It then asks a follow-up question that is appropriate to their answer.

## Design and modifications
The survey was designed to demonstrate the use of SurveyJS, by the SurveyJS development team.
No modifications were made to the survey.

### Template data
The survey has no template placeholders, and so the template data is empty.

<code>templateData = {JSON.stringify(templateData)}</code>
