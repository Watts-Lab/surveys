# Example Survey

This survey is included as a reference for how to include and document new surveys.
Surveys in the `/surveys` folder should be `.json` files containing the SurveyJS
json representation of your survey. 

## Expected behavior
This survey asks about whether the respondent would recommend a product to a friend.
It then asks a follow-up question that is appropriate to their answer.

## Design and modifications
The survey was designed to demonstrate the use of SurveyJS, by the SurveyJS development team.
No modifications were made to the survey to include it in this library.

### Template data
The survey has no template placeholders, and so the template data is empty.

<code>templateData = {JSON.stringify(templateData)}</code>

  </Story>
</Canvas>

# Notes on using this example as a template
You can modify this example to create a new `(yourSurveyName).stories.mdx` file to document `(yourSurveyName).json`.
In addition to the descriptive text, you will need to update the following code sections:
```jsx
import surveyJson from "./(yourSurveyName).json"
export const templateData = {"yourKey":"yourValue"}
```
and
```jsx
<Meta title="Surveys/(yourSurveyName)" component={SurveyWrapper} />
```
and
```jsx
<Story name="(yourSurveyName)" args={{surveyJson: surveyJson}}>
```
and of course in your own `(yourSurveyName).stories.mdx` you can remove this section.
